# Installing Files and Code

The PX4 code can be developed on [Mac OS](../1_Getting-Started/macos.md), [Linux](../1_Getting-Started/linux.md) or [Windows](../1_Getting Started/windows.md). Mac OS and Linux are recommended since image processing and advanced navigation cannot be easily developed on Windows. If unsure, new developers should default to Linux and the current [Ubuntu LTS edition](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS).

## Development Environment

The installation of the development environment is covered below:

- [Mac OS](../1_Getting Started/macos.md)
- [Linux](../1_Getting Started/linux.md)
- [Windows](1_Getting Started/windows.md)

If you're familiar with Docker you can also use one of the prepared containers: [Docker Containers](../12_Debugging and Advanced Topics/advanced-docker.md)

Once finished, continue to the [build instructions](Getting Started/building_the_code.md).
